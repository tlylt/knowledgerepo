# Motivation

I am not afraid to call myself conscientious. I tend to prepare and even over-prepare for tasks that are assigned to me. As a student, I make notes for almost all the subjects that I have taken. It used to be written down in A4 paper and filed away after the exams were over. Then I moved on to digital notetaking, from mindmaps to plain text pointers in a variety of formats. Most recently, I am comfortable using Microsoft OneNote for their smooth connectivity between devices. However, the materials that I had painstakingly typed out remained in my local machine and slowly fade into oblivion, especially during an upgrade of hardware.

Wanted to share my notes freely, I thought of creating a website of my own. But that seemed like a overkill. The website has to be easily updated and support a layout that is essentially and overall text heavy. With the inspiration from CS2030S, I discovered MarkBind, which I believed is a NUS project that meets the need of my requirements. Lately I have been blogging at the DEV platform, with regards to Computer Science and Web development. I have since familiarized myself with Markdown, which is a kind of formatting syntax for writing documents on the web, but with additional styling built in.

Work in progress...
